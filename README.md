Repository that contains my notes about javascript

## Types
- In Javascript, we don't declare the type of the data, for example we can declare and initialize a number variable like that `var n=1`, later in the program we can also change the type of the variable `n="nowitisastringvariable"`. In java for example we need to declare it as follows: `int n=1`, later in the program we can't change the type of `n`.
- Javascript is a dynamically typed language, to learn more, check the following links: [1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1517582/what-is-the-difference-between-statically-typed-and-dynamically-typed-languages), [2](https://android.jlelse.eu/magic-lies-here-statically-typed-vs-dynamically-typed-languages-d151c7f95e2b).

There are two categories of javascript data, the primitive data types and the complex data types. 

## Primitive Values 
- number: One type for decimals and floats, `var n=3.14`.
- string: "str1", 'str2', \`str3\`
- boolean: true or false
- undefined: When we create a variable without assigning a value to it, its value will be undefined, the type also will be undefined.
- null: means an empty value, `var n=null`, the value of n will be null and the  type of n will be object.

## Complex Values 
There are two types in this category, arrays and objects.
- array: [1,'str1',true]
- object: {key1:"value1", key2: 1.5, key3: reu}
